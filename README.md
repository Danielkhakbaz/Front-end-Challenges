# Front-End Challenges

Welcome to my **Front-End Challenges** repository! 🚀

This repository contains solutions to various front-end challenges I find on YouTube. The goal is to practice, improve my front-end development skills, and share my implementations with others.

## 📌 About
- Challenges are sourced from different YouTube videos.
- Each challenge is implemented using modern front-end technologies.
- Solutions are structured to be clean, maintainable, and reusable.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Depending on the challenge, I use a mix of the following technologies:
- **HTML** / **CSS** (Tailwind CSS, SCSS)
- **JavaScript** / **TypeScript**
- **React** / **Next.js**
- Other relevant libraries as needed

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each challenge is organized in its own folder:
```jsx
frontend-challenges/
│── challenge-name-1/
│   └── ...
│
│── challenge-name-2/
│   └── ...
│
│── ...
└── README.md
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```jsx
   git clone https://github.com/danielkhakbaz/front-end-challenges.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a challenge folder:
   ```jsx
   cd challenge-name
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a browser or run the project (if it's a React/Next.js app):
   ```jsx
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
